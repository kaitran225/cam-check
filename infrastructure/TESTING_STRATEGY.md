# CamCheck Mobile App Testing Strategy

This document outlines the testing strategy for the CamCheck Flutter mobile application to ensure a high-quality, reliable, and secure user experience.

## Testing Goals

1. Ensure functionality works as expected across supported devices and platforms
2. Verify API integration with the backend
3. Validate security measures and authentication flow
4. Confirm performance meets target metrics
5. Test WebRTC capabilities in various network conditions
6. Ensure accessibility compliance
7. Validate push notification delivery and handling

## Testing Levels

### Unit Testing

**Target Coverage: 80%**

Unit tests verify the functionality of individual components in isolation.

**Components to Test:**
- API client methods
- Authentication services
- WebRTC connection handling
- State management logic
- Utility functions
- Data models and validation

**Tools:**
- Flutter test package
- Mockito for mocking dependencies
- Fake Async for testing asynchronous code

**Example:**
```dart
void main() {
  group('JwtTokenService', () {
    late JwtTokenService tokenService;
    late MockSecureStorage mockStorage;
    
    setUp(() {
      mockStorage = MockSecureStorage();
      tokenService = JwtTokenService(mockStorage);
    });
    
    test('should store tokens on successful login', () async {
      // Test implementation
    });
    
    test('should clear tokens on logout', () async {
      // Test implementation
    });
    
    test('should refresh token when expired', () async {
      // Test implementation
    });
  });
}
```

### Widget Testing

**Target Coverage: 60%**

Widget tests verify that UI components render correctly and handle user interactions as expected.

**Components to Test:**
- Login/registration forms
- Camera controls
- Session management UI
- Settings screens
- WebRTC call UI
- Error states and loading indicators

**Tools:**
- Flutter test package
- Flutter widget tester
- Golden tests for visual regression testing

**Example:**
```dart
void main() {
  group('LoginScreen', () {
    testWidgets('should show validation errors for empty fields', (WidgetTester tester) async {
      // Test implementation
    });
    
    testWidgets('should call login method when form is valid', (WidgetTester tester) async {
      // Test implementation
    });
    
    testWidgets('should show error message on authentication failure', (WidgetTester tester) async {
      // Test implementation
    });
  });
}
```

### Integration Testing

**Target Coverage: 40%**

Integration tests verify that different parts of the application work together correctly.

**Components to Test:**
- End-to-end authentication flow
- Session creation and joining
- Camera access and streaming
- WebRTC connection establishment
- Push notification handling
- Settings persistence

**Tools:**
- Flutter integration test package
- Firebase Test Lab for device testing
- Mock web server for API simulation

**Example:**
```dart
void main() {
  IntegrationTestWidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  
  group('End-to-end authentication flow', () {
    testWidgets('should allow user to log in and access camera', (WidgetTester tester) async {
      // Test implementation
    });
  });
}
```

### Performance Testing

Performance tests ensure the application meets performance targets and remains responsive.

**Areas to Test:**
- App startup time
- Camera initialization time
- WebRTC connection establishment time
- UI responsiveness during streaming
- Memory usage during extended sessions
- Battery consumption

**Tools:**
- Flutter performance overlay
- DevTools memory profiler
- Custom timing measurements
- Battery usage statistics

**Benchmarks:**
- App startup: < 2 seconds on mid-range devices
- Camera initialization: < 1 second
- WebRTC connection: < 5 seconds on WiFi
- Frame rate: > 24 fps during normal operation
- Memory usage: < 200MB during streaming

### Security Testing

Security tests verify that the application protects user data and prevents unauthorized access.

**Areas to Test:**
- Authentication token handling
- Secure storage implementation
- Certificate pinning
- WebRTC encryption
- Input validation and sanitization
- Session termination and cleanup

**Tools:**
- OWASP Mobile Security Testing Guide
- Network traffic analysis
- Penetration testing tools
- Static code analysis for security issues

**Specific Tests:**
- Verify tokens are securely stored (not in shared preferences)
- Confirm API calls use HTTPS with certificate validation
- Test token expiration and refresh mechanisms
- Verify session data is properly cleared on logout
- Check for sensitive data exposure in logs

### Compatibility Testing

Compatibility tests ensure the app works correctly across different devices, OS versions, and screen sizes.

**Test Matrix:**
- **Android**: API levels 24-34 (Android 7.0-14)
- **iOS**: iOS 13-17
- **Device Types**: Phones, tablets
- **Screen Sizes**: 4.7" to 12.9"
- **Screen Densities**: mdpi to xxxhdpi

**Tools:**
- Firebase Test Lab
- BrowserStack App Live
- Physical device testing lab

### Network Testing

Network tests verify that the application handles different network conditions gracefully.

**Scenarios to Test:**
- WiFi with strong signal
- WiFi with weak signal
- Mobile data (4G/5G)
- Slow network conditions (throttled)
- Network transitions (WiFi to mobile data)
- Network loss and recovery

**Tools:**
- Charles Proxy for network throttling
- Network Link Conditioner
- Custom network simulation tools

### Automated Testing Pipeline
