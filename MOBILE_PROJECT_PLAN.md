## Resource Allocation

### Team Structure

- 2 Flutter Developers
- 1 Backend Developer (maintenance of API)
- 1 UI/UX Designer
- 1 QA Specialist
- 1 Product Manager

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Flutter, Dart
- **State Management**: Provider, Riverpod
- **WebRTC**: flutter_webrtc
- **Notifications**: Firebase Cloud Messaging
- **Authentication**: JWT, Secure Storage
- **Analytics**: Firebase Analytics
- **Crash Reporting**: Firebase Crashlytics

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| WebRTC compatibility issues | High | Medium | Extensive testing on various devices, fallback mechanisms |
| Push notification delivery delays | Medium | Low | Implement local timing verification, server-side retries |
| Battery consumption concerns | High | Medium | Optimize WebRTC usage, implement power-saving mode |
| User resistance to mobile migration | Medium | Medium | Create compelling mobile features, easy transition path |
| API performance under higher mobile load | High | Low | Load testing, scaling plan, performance monitoring |

## Success Metrics

- **User Adoption**: 70% of active web users migrated to mobile within 3 months
- **User Satisfaction**: 4.2+ app store rating
- **Performance**: App startup < 2 seconds, call connection < 5 seconds
- **Stability**: Crash-free sessions > 99.5%
- **Engagement**: 20% increase in average session duration compared to web

## Next Steps
